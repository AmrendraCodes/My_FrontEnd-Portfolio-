            <h2>My Learning Journey</h2>
            <p>My coding journey began with a curiosity about how websites work, which led me to self-study through
                diverse online resources. I believe in 'learning by doing,' so I have spent countless hours building
                real-world projects—from simple landing pages to complex web applications. This hands-on approach has
                taught me not just the syntax, but the logic and best practices behind scalable software development. I
                firmly believe that every bug fixed is a lesson learned.</p>
